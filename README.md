# Framingham-Heart-study
For this analysis, we are interested to describe the smoking habits of the participants in the Framingham Heart study as they age and the impact of smoking on certain health outcomes. The Framingham heart study asks participants about their smoking habits at each visit. In particular, participants are asked if they are currently smoking at this visit (0 = Not a current smoker, 1 = Current smoker), which we will refer to as current smoking status. In addition, participants also report the number of cigarettes they are smoking per day. A more complete description of each of variables in the Framingham Heart study can be found in the Framingham Heart Study Longitudinal Data Documentation.
